# 📘 Quizzer Pro
Quizzer Pro is a modern, AI-augmented study tool designed for mastering medical MCQs using active recall, adaptive spaced repetition (FSRS), and performance-based difficulty adjustment.

This README provides complete documentation on how to use the app, manage decks, create JSON files, and understand the UI.

# 🚀 Features

### 🔹 Smart Adaptive Learning
- FSRS-inspired spaced repetition
- Leitner system integration (Boxes 1–5)
- Session generation based on:
  - Overdue items

  - Dynamically mixed difficulty

### 🔹 Session Persistence
- Automatically saves learning progress to `session_data.json`
- Restores stats, mastery scores, due dates, Leitner states
- Manual toggle in UI to enable/disable loading previous session

### 🔹 Deck Management System
- Save any loaded JSON as a **Deck** with a unique name
- Prevents saving duplicate deck content unless updated
- Select which deck to load in new sessions

### 🔹 Clean, Modern UI (CustomTkinter)
- Dark theme & medical color highlights
- Smooth layout
- Keyboard navigation
- Explanation panel with automatic formatting

# 🖥️ Installation & Running

1. Download **Quizzer Pro.exe** from the release page.

# 🧩 JSON Deck Format (VERY Important)
Quizzer Pro loads MCQs from JSON files structured as follows.

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is example X?",
    "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    "answer": "Option B",
    "explanations": {
      "Option A": "Reason A is incorrect",
      "Option B": "Reason B is correct",
      "Option C": "Reason C is incorrect",
      "Option D": "Reason D is incorrect"
    }
  }
]
```
---

# ⚠️ Case-Sensitivity Rules (Critical)
The `options[]` entries **must match exactly** the keys inside `explanations{}`.

That includes:
- Upper/lowercase letters
- Whitespaces
- Punctuation
- Symbols
- Accents

Example of **incorrect** mapping:

| Options[]         | Explanations key | Status |
|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| "option A"        | "Option A"       | ❌ mismatch |
| "Option  A"       | "Option A"       | ❌ mismatch |
| "Option-A"        | "Option A"       | ❌ mismatch |
| "option a"        | "Option A"       | ❌ mismatch |

Example of **correct** mapping:

| Options[]   | Explanations key | Status |
|-------------|------------------|--------|
| "Option A" | "Option A"       | ✔ perfect match |

If they do not match, the explanation will **not appear**.

# 📚 Creating Decks
You can:
- Load any `.json` file
- Edit using the built-in Deck Editor
- Save as a new deck
- Auto-detect updates

### Deck Storage
Decks are saved in a `decks/` folder.
- Duplicate content is prevented
- If you overwrite a deck's content, it automatically updates

---

# 🧠 Session Data Handling
Quizzer Pro stores progress in:
```
session_data.json
```
Automatically saved:
- Mastery score
- Stability, difficulty
- Leitner box level
- Due dates
- Total/Correct stats

You can disable loading previous session via a toggle.

If session file does not exist:
- A new one is created

# 📘 Example JSON Deck
```json
[
  {
    "question": "Which electrolyte imbalance causes peaked T-waves?",
    "options": ["Hyperkalemia", "Hypokalemia", "Hyponatremia", "Hypercalcemia"],
    "answer": "Hyperkalemia",
    "explanations": {
      "Hyperkalemia": "High K⁺ → peaked T-waves.",
      "Hypokalemia": "Low potassium causes U-waves.",
      "Hyponatremia": "Does not affect T-wave shape.",
      "Hypercalcemia": "Shortens QT interval."
    }
  }
]
```

# 🧰 Troubleshooting
### ✔ App closes instantly when double-clicking `.exe`
Usually caused by:
- Corrupt session file
- Missing write permission

Fix:
1. Delete `session_data.json`
2. Ensure folder is writable

### ✔ Explanations missing
Cause: options do not match explanation keys exactly.
